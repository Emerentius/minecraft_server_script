# Minecraft server script

The init script I used to manage my minecraft server. Based on the [Minecraft Server Manager](https://github.com/msmhq/msm) but cut down to the basics 'cause I was wary of such a huge program in a language as error prone as bash. Extended it a bit later again with jar updates, backups and tab completion for everything including the server jar versions, though the latter is still lost somewhere on my hard drive.

Supports a single server with 1 world only. Can start, stop, restart, update the server, backup the world, send commands to the mc server console and open the server console.
